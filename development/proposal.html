                For my project, I will be working on the intersection between AI and social justice. My target audience includes individuals interested in both technology and social justice issues. This could encompass a diverse range of people like activists, technologists, and concerned citizens.I think working with a partner would help to bring more diverse perspectives to the project, but I am not sure who my partner would be.
            </p>

                Features included in project/product:<br>
                - Case Studies: Highlighting real-world examples<br>
                - Educational Content: providing accessible & informative resources

                My project is inspired by . . .<br>
                Speculative Design: can create artifacts, scenarios, or narratives that provoke critical thinking and discussion about the implications of AI on marginalized communities and societal structures.<br>

                Challenging Mental Models: exploration of alternative viewpoints and solutions to address systemic inequalities perpetuated by AI technologies.<br>

                Data Visualization: patterns, disparities, and impacts that might otherwise be overlooked.<br>

                Ethical Frameworks and Human Rights: analyzing how AI systems can either respect or infringe upon basic rights like privacy and fair treatment, especially among marginalized groups.<br>

                Given the remaining time constraint for this class. . . 
                <br>I need to specify my focus and think about what is feasable in the remaining weeks as I tend to take on more work than I can chew.
