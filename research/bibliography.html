            Hilke Schellmann's book "The Algorithm" investigates AI tools used in hiring and exposes their significant flaws and biases. She experimented with a tool called myInterview and found it could inaccurately score candidates based on how they spoke, even if their answers were irrelevant or in another language. Schellmann also critiques other AI hiring tools like CV screeners and social media analysis, showing they can be unreliable and discriminatory. She urges HR departments to scrutinize these tools and calls for regulations to ensure they are fair and transparent. Meanwhile, jobseekers can use AI like ChatGPT to improve their job applications.

            AI tools are becoming common in hiring, leading to concerns about discrimination. About 70% of companies, including almost all Fortune 500 firms, use AI in hiring, especially in lower-wage jobs with many Black and Latin workers. These tools screen resumes, judge personality traits, and analyze video interviews, often using biased data. The traits they measure may not relate to job performance and can discriminate, especially against people with disabilities. The process is not transparent, making it hard for applicants to know how decisions are made or to ask for accommodations, complicating the detection and prevention of discrimination.
        </p>

        <p>
            To prevent discrimination in hiring, AI tools should be checked by third parties for bias, and applicants should be informed and given necessary accommodations. Strong enforcement of anti-discrimination laws is crucial. Lawmakers are working on laws to ensure fairness by requiring employers to inform applicants about AI use and to assess the impact of these tools.

Many workers are eager to let AI handle boring tasks, but it's important to learn AI tools and focus on skills like storytelling and building relationships. Jobs will change, with managers focusing more on coaching. Companies should let employees safely try out AI and see them as a source of new ideas.
